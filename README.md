# Finite-Automata-project

A C Program for Simulation of Finite Automata as a Part of Discrete Mathematical Structures Course Project

A finite-state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation, implemented 
with hardware or software and can be used to simulate sequential logic and some 
other computer programs. It is an abstract machine that transitions to one of the states at a 
given time based on given inputs and the grammar that defines the rules for the transitions. 

In this project we developed a working and functional C-Library which contains the structures 
and application programming interface required to execute any finite state machine, 
an application c program to validate the input and provide appropriate output.
